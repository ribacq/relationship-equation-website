# The Relationship Equation

--> https://ribacq.github.io/relationship-equation-website

This website is an English class project presenting what is here named, ‘the Relationship Equation’,
a mathematical sequence, the members of which represent the overall ‘mood’ of two members of a
couple, or two countries in a geopolitical conflict, or two buisiness companies, etc.

The idea of this website came from [this numberphile video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkOIw7vAZCQ).

## Math
In a married couple:

`[TeX] W_{t+1} = w + r_w W_t + I_{HW}(H_t)`

## Technologies
* _HTML5_ & _CSS3_
* _JS_ & `<canvas>` elements for the animation
* _LaTeX_ for the formulas

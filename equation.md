# The Relationship Equation

`$$ H_{t+1} = h + r_h H_t + I_{HW}(W_t) $$`

`$$ H_{t+1} $$`: Husband’s next mood state

*=*

`$$ h $$`: Husband’s “basic” mood state

*+*

`$$ r_h $$`: Husband’s capacity to stay in his mood over time, emotional inertia

*×*

`$$ H_t $$`: Husband’s current mood state

*+*

`$$ I_{WH} $$`: a mathematical function indicating the wife’s influence on the husband

*(*

`$$ W_t $$`: Wife’s current mood state

*)*

In simple terms, each partner’s next mood state is the sum of their “basic mood”, their previous
state, and the influence the other partner has on them.

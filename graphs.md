# Graphs
The beautiful thing with equations in maths, is that you can plot them into graphs, thus providing a
much easier reading of the evolution tendencies. That is especially true with qualitative equations
such as **The Relationship Equation**. In this case, there are two different tracing methods that
are used to provide clarity.

## Mood over time

*insert interactive graphs here*

On this, the moods of the two members of the relationship are plotted over time. The goal is to see
whereto the moods tend to go, and when or if they stabilize. You may fumble with the controls, may
you wish to see how well your conception of a relationship and that of **The Relationship Equation**
are alike!

## Partner 1 over partner 2
*insert interactive graphs here*

And here, time is not explicitely shown, but the moods of the to partners are plotted relatively to
each other. The interest here is to see how well a given partner will be with another given partner.
It is also remarkable to see the relationship sometimes *literally* spiraling.

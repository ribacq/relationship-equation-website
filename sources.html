				The relationship equation is a work from Hannah Fry. Hannah Fry is a british mathematician who studied in the University College of London. She has published two books, “Proof that Santa Claus exists : The Mathematics of Christmas” and “The Mathematics of Love” which she also did a Ted Talk about. It's from this book that come The Relationship equation including other aspects of love based on mathematical aspects. Hannah Fry's belief is that almost everything can be related to Maths which she proves with this equation.

				She herself based her work on a study from 2 guys who filmed couples arguing and used all the data collected to come up with her equation.
